# Toebeans

Toe grips for dogs which have trouble on slippery floors/surfaces

As our Sheepdog aged he had increasingly more troubles on our hardwood floors.  Each time he slipped or fell it made him less confident and us feel more helpless. 

I ordered a commercial set of these at $60USD to me here in Canada and knew I could do better.  Here is the commercial ones in case you want to buy them https://shop.toegrips.com/products/toegrips

I designed these in Freecad and you can customize them to fit your dog and print them out yourself!  

Here is a detailed video on how they work : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYg6hkmdTeE&ab_channel=ToeGrips

## Instructions:

- Measure : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRrzz1uOwbI&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=ToeGrips

- Size in FreeCad as you need by changing the diameter of the 2 radius values here:

-  Print in TPU filament

- You can even use my tuned TPU settings in my Github Repo here:https://github.com/MKme/I3-Mega-3D-Printer-Settings-Resources  

- and for the CR10 here: https://github.com/MKme/CR10-3D-Printer-Settings-and-Reference

## Sizes (Commerical versions)

Nail Circumference	| Size
| ---------- |----------------|
9-12mm	| XS	
13-15mm	|S	
16-19mm|	M	 
20-23mm	|L	
24-27mm	|XL	
28-30mm|	XXL	 
31-36mm	|XXXL

## Notes:

- Made them to thin first versions to test fit then tweaked diameter larger after
- 10 mm seems like a perfect height 

###  Size tests 

- 4.7 inner too big
- 3.7 too small
- 4.2 near perfect but slid up too high during a walk 
- From here moved from 1 to 2mm thick
- 4.1x6.1 

###  TBD

- Chamfer top edge in case they ride up
- Leave bottom edge square for max grips
- Grip pattern like a tire?
- More infill needed or fine as they are?
