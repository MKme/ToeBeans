# ToeBeans

Toe grips for dogs which have trouble on slippery floors/surfaces

As our Sheepdog Riggs aged he had increasingly more troubles on our hardwood floors.  Each time he slipped or fell it made him less confident and us feel more helpless. 

I ordered a commercial set of these at $60USD to me here in Canada and knew I could do better.  Here is the commercial ones in case you want to buy them https://shop.toegrips.com/products/toegrips

I designed these in Freecad and you can customize them to fit your dog and print them out yourself!

### Instructions:

- Size in FreeCad as you need by changing the diameter of the 2 radius values here: 


-  Print in TPU filament

- You can even use my tuned TPU settings in my Github Repo here:https://github.com/MKme/I3-Mega-3D-Printer-Settings-Resources  and for the CR10 here: https://github.com/MKme/CR10-3D-Printer-Settings-and-Reference
